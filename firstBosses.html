		<h1 class="center">Introduction to Bosses &#45; Who are They?</h1>
		<p>Warframe is an RPG, with a clear story to be discovered as you progress through the game. As with any good RPG, there are Bosses in your way to try and stop you from going further. Here, we will discuss the first three Bosses you will fight as a Tenno.</p>
		<!--Some people don't know this, but the first three Bosses are actually two, as the first and third Boss are the same enemy, only with a slightly different fight.-->
		<h2 class="center">Boss #1 &#45; Captain Vor</h2>

		<h3>Information</h3>
		<p>Vor is the first Boss a player will ever meet. He is introduced during the tutorial. Vor is a power&#45;hungry character, hoping to cure the genetic defects within his fellow Grineer. He seems to understand Ancient Orokin technology, and uses it to create his mighty Seer Pistol, his armor and a Void Key that powers his equipment. Vor wanted to kill the Tenno, but also wished to bring them to his Twin Queens and attempt to cure the Grineer genetic defects. 
		<h3>The Battle</h3> 
		<p>In battle, Vor is a powerful combatant, boasting a shield, heavy armor and a decently high amount of health. He has the ability to teleport, and this can lead to a more challenging battle. However, if the player literally corners him, he will only be able to teleport in place, allowing the player to finish him easily. Being the first Boss, this fight is not too difficult.</p>
		<h2 class="center">Boss #2 &#45; The Jackal</h2>
		<img class="center" src="Images/Jackal.png" width="450" height="450" alt="The Jackal">
		<h3>Information</h3>
		<p>The Jackal is the second Boss in Warframe. This mechanical creature, made by the Corpus, is responsible for many Tenno deaths, and it must be destroyed. The four&#45;legged behemoth is equipped with guns, missles, grenades and the ability to stomp like the Corpus Shockwave MOAs, knocking the player down.</p>
		<h3>The Battle</h3>
		<p>The Jackal is quite difficult for new players. It is invulnerable until one of its legs is damaged. Put simply, the player must destory one of its legs, before attacking the head to deal damage. Once enough damage is dealt, The Jackal will fall to the ground, never to rise again. Beware of the stomp ability, as it can disrupt your combat until one of the legs are taken down. Do note that The Jackal is heavily armored, boasts a mightly shield, and cannot be truly hurt until a leg is damaged. The legs recover after some time as well, but you can go after the same leg each time.</p>
		<h2 class="center">Boss #3 &#45; Captain Vor...Again</h2>
		<img class="center" src="Images/Vor2.png" width="300" height="450" alt="Captain Vor">
		<h3>Information</h3>
		<p>W&#45;what? Why? Just why? You...oh, never mind.</p>
		<h3>The Battle</h3>
		<p>Since your encounter in the tutorial, Vor has learned some new tricks. Along with increased stats, he now has more than one life. Upon the player killing him once, Vor will revive and continue the fight with the Tenno. He will revive two times, so the player has to kill him three times to truly end the battle. Each time he revives, he seems to teleport immediately, although occasionally he will stay and continue the fight in place.</p>
		<p>Oh, by the way, Vor comes back again later on in a third fight, where he works alongside fellow Grineer Lech Kril, a Boss who shows up for the first time a little while after this fight. And then he shows up a fourth time in the Void. This guy needs to learn when to quit.</p>
		<!--I feel it is not necessary for me to discuss any other Boss fights, as there are many more and it would not make sense for a beginner guide.-->
		<p>It is extremely important to know how Bosses work in order to swiftly progress through the rest of the game.
