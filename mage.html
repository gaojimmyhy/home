		<p id="Ita">This is Nova, wildly unpredictable. Nova&#39;s presence on the battlefield is complex and deadly. Handle with care, Tenno.</p>
		<p>&#45; The Lotus</p>
		<p>The Nova Warframe is a classic Mage, relying on her Abilities to make a huge impact on the battlefield. From teleportation to damage, to a countermeasure against knockdowns, Nova has it all in her Ability kit. She does not need to rely on her weapons too much due to her escape and damage potential. When knocked down, her Passive Ability will also knock down all enemies within a 6 meter radius of her, making Nova very effective against the Corpus Shockwave MOAs.</p>
		<!--I feel like it is important to stress the word "need" in the above paragraph. Technically, all Warframes can rely on only weapons or only Abilities, but Mages just tend to favor their Abilities more. Just because a Warrior, such as Excalibur, will still consistently use their Abilities, it does not mean that they are Mages.-->

They will automatically launch themselves at enemies within up to 12 meters, dealing up to 200 damage each. Particles will orbit for at least one second before firing, and will not fire simultaneously. The particles will not vanish over time, they must be used. This Ability cannot be cast again until all particles have been used. As long as there are still particles orbiting Nova, she is immune to the knockdown effect.</td>

This orb absorbs all damage when shot at, and will explode upon contact with an enemy, ally or terrain, dealing up to 200 damage, plus up to four times the damage the orb had absorbed. The explosion has a radius of up to 15 meters. If the orb explodes from hitting an enemy, the target takes an additional 10 damage.

These wormholes last up to 16 seconds, or until the wormhole limit is exceeded. If the limit is exceeded, the first wormhole to be made will collapse. Otherwise, each wormhole is on a timer as well.

Affected enemies move and attack up to 30&#37; slower and explode upon death, dealing up to 800 damage to all enemies within up to 10 meters of them. All affected enemies take double damage from all sources. Nova is immune to the knockdown effect while casting this Ability. SHe is, however, vulnerable to damage. This Ability can be cast in midair.</td>
