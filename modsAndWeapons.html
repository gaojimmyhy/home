		<h1 class="center">Ranks</h1>
		<p>All items have ranks in Warframe, ranging from Unranked to Rank 30. Items the Tenno have will be ranked up, if possible, by having the item equipped and simply using it. The Rank of an item determines the amount of Mods it can hold, as along with Mod slots, there is a capacity feature that prevents overloaded Warframes and weapons, amongst other things.</p>
		<a href="#Mods">Jump to the Mods section...</a>
		<h1 class="center">Weapons</h1>
		<p>The Tenno are masters of gun and blade, the weapons of the old, as they were trained to fight the Sentients, who could only harness new technology. From silent weapons like the Paris bow to loud guns like the Lato handgun, the Tenno were adept at using all of them to their advantages. During the tutorial, the player will have a choice of primary, secondary&#47;sidearm and melee weapons.</p>
		<!--There are dozens of weapon in the game which would have taken far too long to discuss, so I decided to stick to talking about the weapons chosen as a starting player.-->
		<!--There are weapons such as sniper rifles and dual swords, for example, but we will not be discussing those here.-->
		<p>The first weapon the Tenno must choose is their melee weapon.</p>

				<td class="center">Skana<img class="center" src="Images/Skana.png" width="300" height="200" alt="The Skana"></td>
				<td>The Skana is a standard issue sword. It is thin, sleek and quick. What it lacks in flat damage it makes up for in speed. It is still reliable, can pull off quick kills in the early game, and is my personal recommendation.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="center">MK1&#45;Bo<img class="center" src="Images/Bo.png" width="300" height="200" alt="The MK1-Bo"></td>
				<td>The MK1&#45;Bo, which is a weaker version of the Bo, is a long range, high damage melee weapon. It trades speed for pure damage. It is recommended to have some sort of speed&#45;boosting Ability or Mod to assist this weapon.</td>
				</tr>
		</table>
		<p>The Tenno&#39;s next weapon is their sidearm, also known as their secondary weapon.</p>

			<tr>
				<td class="center">Lato<img class="center" src="Images/Lato.png" width="300" height="200" alt="The Lato"></td>
				<td>The Lato is a handgun, both loud and quick. Its low damage is partially compensated for by its high fire rate and high accuracy. Be weary, however, as this loud gun attracts attention and can even ruin a spy, assassination or capture mission, due to an overall lack of damage output. This weapon is generaly preferred.</td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="center">MK1&#45;Kunai<img class="center" src="Images/Kunai.png" width="300" height="200" alt="The MK1-Kunai"></td>
				<td>The MK1&#45;Kunai, which is a weaker version of the Kunai, is a silent set of throwing knives. This weapon does not do a lot of damage, but is quite accurate and completely silent. If the player plans to choose the MK1&#45;Braton as a primary, this is a crucial item to pick up. Otherwise, lots of people prefer the Lato.</td>
			</tr>

		<p>The final weapon the Tenno must choose is their primary weapon.</p>

				<td class="center">MK1&#45;Paris<img class="center" src="Images/Paris.png" width="300" height="200" alt="The MK1-Paris"></td>
				<td>The MK1&#45;Paris, which is a weaker version of the Paris, is a bow made for assassinations. This weapon is quick and deadly, but is not ideal for fighting large groups, such as the Grineer marines. It generally deals higher damage, and is my personal recommendation.</td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="center">MK1&#45;Braton<img class="center" src="Images/Braton.png" width="300" height="200" alt="The MK1-Braton"></td>
				<td>The MK1&#45;Braton, which is a weaker version of the Braton, is a fully automatic rifle, and is a standard issue weapon. It does, however, lack the damage and silence which the Paris has. It does, however, have a higher attack speed, meaning it is better against large groups.</td> 
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>As players progress through the game, they will uncover different types of weapons. It is recommended that players try out many different types of weapons to see what they enjoy using, before choosing a final arsenal.
		<h1 id="Mods" class="center">Mods</h1>
		<!--Here I discuss some basic Mods. I do not go into Mods used on allies and such, as players who literally just started the game will not have access to these components, and therefore will be able to learn how they work as trhe game progresses on.-->
		<p>Another important part of Warframe comes in the form of Mods. These items allow the player to modify the abilities of a weapon, Warframe, companion or other item, many of which are not important at the very beginning of the game and will be learned as the player progresses. These Mods can affect the performance of Warframe Abilities, the Energy resource which is used to cast them, or other weapon&#45;related stats amongst other things.</p>
		<h2>Mod Rarities and Types</h2>
		<!--I discuss the four rarities and eleven types of Mods before I go into the four important Mod stats that most Warframes will use.-->
		<p>Mods come in four rarities, and eleven different types. However, one kind of mod classifies as its own rarity and its own type, hence why there are eleven types instead of ten.</p>
