		<p>Do you like gunning enemies down? Do you like guns, bows and anything else that shoots? Do you like blindfolding yourself for no reason at all? If so, the Ranger Archetype is for you.</p>
		<h2 class="center">Example of a Ranger Warframe &#45; Mesa</h2>
		<img class="center" src="Images/Mesa.png" width="300" height="600" alt="The Mesa Warframe">
		<p id="Ita">This is Mesa, the vagabond, the outcast. Do you feel lucky, Tenno? Mesa&#39;s got the fastest guns in the stars.</p>
		<p>&#45; The Lotus</p>
		<p>Mesa is a master of guns. Her proficiency with her secondary weapon is extremely high. She gains 10&#37; bonus attack speed for dual sidearms and 20&#37; reload speed with one handed sidearms. This makes low fire rate dual sidearms and slow reload one handed sidearms very effective on her, as Mesa makes up for their flaws. Bearing a dual secondary with a fast fire rate, however, lets Mesa shoot even faster. It is recommended to unequip your melee weapon when using Mesa outside of Conclave, as she gains 50 bonus Health without it.</p>

				<td>Consumes 25 Energy. Mesa stores up to 70&#37; of damage dealth by her primary and secondary weapons. Up to 140 damage can be stored for every shot, and up to 1600 damage can be stored overall. When this Ability is triggered a second time, no Energy is consumed, but the next gunshot Mesa fires will deal bonus damage equivalent to the damage stored. Mesa can use this Ability to increase the damage of one of her Peacemaker shots. Upon the first cast of this Ability, Mesa&#39;s body will begin to glow, with the intensity of the light increasing along with the damage stored.</td>

				<td class="center">Shooting Gallery<img src="Images/Mesa2.png" width="200" height="200" alt="The Shooting Gallery Ability in action"></td>
				<td>Consumes 50 Energy. Mesa draws her lasso, gaining up to 25&#37; bonus damage on every attack for up to 30 seconds. Every 1.5 seconds, 3 enemies within up to 16 meters will be attacked by the lasso, briefly jamming their ranged weapons. Melee enemies will instead be stunned for the duration. If Mesa is in a group, she will spawn an additional lasso that travels between her allies and gives them the same buffs, all while retaining the buff for herself for the full duration. The additional lasso will jump from one ally to another, with the amount of time the lasso stays with each ally being equal.</td> 
				<!--This means that with one ally, they gain the buff along with Mesa for 30 seconds. With two allies, they each gain it for 15 seconds, and not simultaneously. And finally, with 3 allies, each player gains the buff for 10 seconds except for Mesa, who still gains it for the full 30 second duration.-->

She has a 25&#37; critical hit chance, with critical hits multiplying shot damage by an additional 3 times. These shots have 100&#37; accuracy. Maximum damage is attained by firing 40 shots then landing a critical hit with the Ballistic Battery buff and the Shooting Gallery buff. This Ability also passively drains 15 Energy per second as long as it is activated, meaning it is considered a toggle Ability.</td>
