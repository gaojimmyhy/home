		<p>Do you like taking damage? Do you like laughing in the face of death? Do you like standing in the middle of a fight as if nothing is happening? If so, the Tank Archetype is for you.</p>
		<h2 class="center">Example of a Tank Warframe &#45; Rhino</h2>
		<img class="center" src="Images/Rhino.png" width="300" height="600" alt="The Rhino Warframe">
		<p id="Ita">This is Rhino, an immovable force and highly resilient. Rhino can survive alone or become the cornerstone of any squad, Tenno. The choice is yours.</p>
		<p>&#45; The Lotus</p>
		<p>The Rhino Warframe is a heavy&#45;duty fighter, able to resist damage and dish out just as much. When falling from high ground, instead of staggering, Rhino will crash down and create a shockwave with a radius of 6 meters, dealing damage and knocking all enemies in the area down.</p>
