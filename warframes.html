		<h1 class="center">Types of Warframes</h1>
		<p>Warframes come in many different Archetypes. They are, in no particular order&#58;</p>
		<!--There are formal names for all the Archetypes, but some of them are too specific. For the sake of this project, I decided to narrow it down to five broad Archetypes.-->
		<!--Some Warframes fall under multiple Archetypes. In those situations, I used my own opinion as to what type they are considered.-->
		<ul>
			<li>Stealth</li>
			<!--In this case, Stealth Warframes classify as any Warframe with a stealth mechanic, such as invisibility or a teleport.-->
			<li>Warrior</li>
			<!--In this case, Warrior Warframes are Warframes that simply fit under none of the other four Archetypes. This is the most broad Archetype.-->
			<li>Tank</li>
			<!--In this case, Tank Warframes are Warframes built to take damage and survive. This often includes damage reduction buffs or complete invulnerability.-->
			<li>Mage&#47;Caster&#47;Support</li>
			<!--In this case, Mage Warframes are Warframes that mainly rely on Abilities instead of weapons. They are also often, but not necessarily, ranged. Another name for a Warframe that classifies as the Mage Archetype is a Caster. For the sake of this project, I placed support Warframes under this Archetype as well. This is, therefore, the largest Archetype.-->
			<li>Ranger</li>
			<!--In this case, Ranger Warframes are Warframes that are ranged, but do not rely on Abilities. This is also a very simple and small Archetype containing Warframes that sit on the line between being a Warrior and a Mage.-->
		</ul>
		<h2 class="center">Which Archetype is Right for You?</h2>
		<img class="center" src="Images/Confused.png" width="400" height="700" alt="Which Warframe Archetype is right for you?">
		<p>Good question. It depends on your playstyle. My suggestion is to read through the Archetypes and select one that seems to suit your playstyle. The following are links to pages detailing each Archetype. Pick wisely&#33;</p>
		<p><a href="stealth.html">I like sneaking around, stealing data and performing assassinations&#33; Stealth Archetype...</a></p>
		<p><a href="warrior.html">I like running into a battlefield and leading the charge&#33; Warrior Archetype...</a></p>
		<p><a href="tank.html">I like soaking up damage and protecting my allies&#33; Tank Archetype...</a></p>
		<p><a href="mage.html">I like firing from a range to deal massive area of effect damage, or healing my allies&#33; Mage&#47;Caster&#47;Support Archetype...</a></p>
		<p><a href="ranger.html">I like gunning down my enemies from far away, picking them off with ease&#33; Ranger Archetype...</a></p>
		<p>The Archetype you choose will influence your role in a team, and your effectiveness on your own in solo gameplay. With 31 distinct Warframes, it is easy to pick one that suits you...both literally and figuratively.</p>
		<!--Get it? Suits you? As in a Warframe is a suit of armor? Oh, never mind...-->
