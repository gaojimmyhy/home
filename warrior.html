		<p>Do you like beating enemies into the ground? Do you like exclusive weapons? Do you like dealing way too much damage? If so, the Warrior Archetype is for you.</p>
		<h2 class="center">Example of a Warrior Warframe &#45; Nidus</h2>
		<img class="center" src="Images/Nidus.png" width="300" height="400" alt="The Nidus Warframe">
		<p id="Ita">This is Nidus, the adaptive, the scourge. Nidus is a deadly plague for which there is no cure. You must control the strange disease.</p>
		<p>&#45; The Lotus</p>
		<p>The Nidus Warframe uses the powers of the Infestation itself, created by his Orokin ancestors, to fight his enemies. Having no Shields by default, Nidus relies on Warrior&#45;styled combat to keep enemies at bay. By using his first two Abilities, every hit on an enemy will grant Nidus his Passive Mutation Stacks, one stack per enemy hit, and up to a total of 100 stacks. These are used to cast his third and his Ultimate Abilities. If Nidus dies with 15 or more stacks, then 15 stacks will be consumed, reviving Nidus, making him invulnerable for 5 seconds, and restoring 50&#37; of his max Health. On top of all that, just by Ranking up, Nidus gains up to 50&#37; Armor, 13 Health regeneration and 15&#37; Power Strength.</p>
